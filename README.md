# harbor-plat-mesh-pipe

`harbor-plat-mesh-pipe` is a Java project for Platform engineering. It turns package a Java local lab for mesh analysis with safe and unsafe fixtures, remediation hints, and documented operating limits into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Harbor Plat Mesh Pipe

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## Purpose

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Design Sketch

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying platform engineering behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The Java implementation uses a compact package layout and direct assertion checks.

## Fixture Notes

The extended cases are not random smoke tests. `degraded` keeps pressure on the review path, while `surge` shows the model when capacity and weight are strong enough to clear the threshold.

## What It Does

- Uses fixture data to keep route policy changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for rollout constraints, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents environment checks tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Setup

Install Java and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Limits

The repository favors determinism over breadth. It does not pull live data, keep secrets, or depend on network access for verification.

## Next Directions

- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add one more platform engineering fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.
